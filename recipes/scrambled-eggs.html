    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ Tbsp butter</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt, <em>or more to taste</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a medium non-stick pan over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Crack eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and whisk until well blended.</li>
        <li>When the butter begins to bubble, pour in the eggs and immediately use a silicone spatula to swirl in small
            circles around the pan, without stopping, until the eggs look slightly thickened and very small curds begin
            to form, about <strong>30 seconds</strong>.</li>
        <li>Change from kaing circles to making long sweeps across the pan until you see larger, creamy curds; about
            <strong>20 seconds</strong>.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places, remove the pan from the heat and leave for a few
            seconds to finish cooking. Give a final stir and serve immediately. Serve with an extra sprinkle of salt, a
            grind of black pepper and a few fresh chopped herbs (if desired).</li>
    </ol>
